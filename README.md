# Weather App
The aim of this project was to create a weather app where users can input a city and view the weather type and temperature of that city. The original project requirements can be found on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API which can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/current).
